As I've taught different stats classes, I've found that one of the regression diagnostic statistics that students really glom onto is $R^2$. Unlike lots of regression diagnostics like AIC, BIC, and the joint F-statistic, $R^2$ has a really intuitive interpretation—it's the percent of variation in the outcome variable explained by all the explanatory variables. For instance, let's explain global life expectancy using GDP per capita, based on data from [the Gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/). Here's the basic model:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Life expectancy}} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{GDP per capita} + \\epsilon\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)     # For ggplot, dplyr, and friends\nlibrary(broom)         # For converting models into data frames\nlibrary(gapminder)     # For health and wealth data\nlibrary(faux)          # For generating fake data\nlibrary(eulerr)        # For creating Euler and Venn diagrams\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Just look at 2007\ngapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>%\n  filter(year == 2007)\n\nsuper_naive_model <- lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder_2007)\ntidy(super_naive_model)\n## # A tibble: 2 × 5\n##   term         estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n##   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n## 1 (Intercept) 59.6      1.01           59.0 9.89e-101\n## 2 gdpPercap    0.000637 0.0000583      10.9 1.69e- 20\nglance(super_naive_model)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 12\n##   r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic  p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC deviance\n##       <dbl>         <dbl> <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>\n## 1     0.461         0.457  8.90      120. 1.69e-20     1  -511. 1028. 1037.   11086.\n## # ℹ 2 more variables: df.residual <int>, nobs <int>\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is an awful model on theoretical grounds, but whatever. A \\$1 increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 0.001 year increase in life expectancy, on average. Look at all those diagnostics though—AIC? BIC? LogLik? Those are important, but definitely not intuitive. The $R^2$ value, on the other hand, is nice and interpretable. GDP per capita explains 46.1% of the variation in life expectancy. That's soundbite-worthy. Students love it.\n\nPeople also love to critique models based on it. In my program evaluation class, a model in one of my problem sets has an $R^2$ of 0.02, and without fail, a majority of students dismiss it because of its low explanatory power. It only explains 2% of the variation in the outcome! It must be junk!\n\nBut low $R^2$s aren't necessarily bad. And while saying that a model explains X% of the variation in an outcome, what does that even mean in practice?\n\nSo how the heck does $R^2$ work anyway? I've struggled teaching this, but recently a friend mentioned that she teaches students to imagine $R^2$ as a combination of overlapping circles, or a type of Venn diagram. I'd never heard of this approach before, so I went down a really interesting rabbit hole to discover that this approach has actually been used for decades! Let's go down that rabbit hole together!\n\n\n## Regression as overlapping circles\n\nThe earliest example I found is @CohenCohen:1975, who proposed visualizing the shared variance between 2–3 variables as a \"ballantine\" graph (apparently named after [an ale logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Ballantine_and_Sons_Brewing_Company)?), or what we call nowadays a Venn or Euler diagram. Others refined their approach, like @Hunt:1986 who provides all sorts of fancy geometric equations to make them accurate (and provides some neat vintage Pascal code in the appendix!), and @Ip:2001, who shows a bunch of different examples and highlights some of the limitations of using this approach.\n\nFor this ongoing example, we'll simulate some correlated data using [the **faux** package](https://debruine.github.io/faux/). We could use real data, but as you'll see, these diagrams are pretty finicky and fragile and generally need very tame data to work. Here we'll create data with three variables that are normally distributed with these parameters:\n\n- `Y`: mean = 10, sd = 2\n- `X1`: mean = 9, sd = 1.7\n- `X2`: mean = 9, sd = 1.3\n\nWe'll make `Y` and `X1` be correlated at r = 0.5, `Y` and `X2` correlated at r = 0.3, and `X1` and `X2` correlated at r = 0.4:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\ndf <- rnorm_multi(n = 100,\n                  mu = c(10, 9, 9),\n                  sd = c(2, 1.7, 1.3),\n                  r = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.4),\n                  varnames = c(\"Y\", \"X1\", \"X2\"),\n                  empirical = FALSE)\n\n# Look at the first few rows\nhead(df)\n##       Y    X1    X2\n## 1  8.22  6.73  8.38\n## 2 10.17  9.36 10.12\n## 3 12.03 10.32  9.86\n## 4  5.41  5.80  8.38\n## 5 10.10 10.08 10.09\n## 6 11.13  9.11  9.94\n\n# Check if the correlations worked\ncor(df)\n##        Y    X1    X2\n## Y  1.000 0.453 0.373\n## X1 0.453 1.000 0.468\n## X2 0.373 0.468 1.000\n# Close enough!\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn these regression diagrams, each variable is shown as a circle sized according to its variance, or:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{var} = \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum (\\color{gray}{\\overbrace{\\color{black}{x_i}}^{\\substack{\\text{Single} \\\\ \\text{value}}}} - \\color{gray}{\\overbrace{\\color{black}{\\bar{x}}}^{\\substack{\\text{Mean of} \\\\ \\text{all values}}}\\color{black}{)^2}}}{\\color{gray}{\\underbrace{\\color{black}{n}}_{\\substack{\\text{Sample} \\\\ \\text{size}}}}-1}\n$$\n\nAccording to @Ip:2001, you can also size the circles based on just the numerator of that equation, or the sum-of-squares, which is the same value proportionally number (it's just not divided by $n-1$). It's also easier to work with when plotting, so that's what we'll use throughout this example.\n\n$$\n\\color{gray}{\\overbrace{\\color{black}{{\\scriptstyle\\sum} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}^{\\text{Sum of squares}}}\n$$\n\nWe can even make a little function to calculate the sum of squares for us:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sum of squares, or the numerator of the variance equation\nss <- function(x) {\n  sum((x - mean(x))^2)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nEnough math, though—let's make some plots! We'll use [the **eulerr** package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eulerr/vignettes/introduction.html) for this, since (1) it calculates proportional overlaps between circles (that's the key technical difference between Venn and Euler diagram—Venn diagrams are supposed to have equally sized overlapping areas), and (2) it uses grid graphics, so it fits nicely in the ggplot ecosystem.\n\n### Relationship between two variables\n\nFirst let's just look at the relationship between `Y` and `X1`. We'll use the sum of squares to calculate the size for each circle:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nss_y <- ss(df$Y)\nss_x1 <- ss(df$X1)\n\nplot(euler(c(\"Y\" = ss_y,\n             \"X1\" = ss_x1)),\n     quantities = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unrelated-vars-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJust looking at this plot, we can see that `Y` has more variation than `X1`. Neat.\n\nThese two variables are related to each other though and have some covariance. We can calculate the shared covariance using [ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance). Ordinarily you need to feed R's `anova()` function an `lm()` object to calculate different variance statistics (e.g. `anova(lm(Y ~ X1, data = df))`), but to save some typing, you can also use the `aov()` function to skip the intermediate `lm()` step. The nice thing about using the sum of squares values for these diagrams rather than variance values is that `aov()` reports its results as sums of squares, so we can use those results directly.\n\nLet's see how much of the variation between `Y` and `X1` is shared:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naov(Y ~ X1, data = df)\n## Call:\n##    aov(formula = Y ~ X1, data = df)\n## \n## Terms:\n##                  X1 Residuals\n## Sum of Squares   82       318\n## Deg. of Freedom   1        98\n## \n## Residual standard error: 1.8\n## Estimated effects may be unbalanced\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we look at the sum of squares row, we can see that 81.98 sum-of-squares units (whatever those mean) are shared between the two variables, with 317.87 not shared (or residual). To plot this overlap, we need to do a little bit of set theory math. We can't just tell `Y` to be 399 units big—we need to subtract the shared space from both `Y` and `X1`. We'll extract the sum of squares value from `aov()` (using `broom::tidy()` to make this easier):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nss_both_y_x1 <- aov(Y ~ X1, data = df) %>%\n  tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == \"X1\") %>%\n  pull(sumsq)\nss_both_y_x1\n## [1] 82\n\nplot(euler(c(\"Y\" = ss_y - ss_both_y_x1,\n             \"X1\" = ss_x1 - ss_both_y_x1,\n             \"Y&X1\" = ss_both_y_x1)),\n     quantities = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-basic-overlap-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we can visualize the covariance between these two variables! Let's get rid of the raw numbers and add some letters for the different segments:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(euler(c(\"Y\" = ss_y - ss_both_y_x1,\n             \"X1\" = ss_x1 - ss_both_y_x1,\n             \"Y&X1\" = ss_both_y_x1)),\n     quantities = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-basic-overlap-labels-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nArea C here represents the amount of variation in `Y` explained by `X1`, while Area A represents the unexplained portion of `Y`. In regression language, A is basically the error term:\n\n$$\n\\hat{Y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\color{gray}{\\overbrace{\\epsilon}^{\\color{black}{\\text{A}}}}\n$$\n\nThe great thing about visualizing this is that C also represents the $R^2$! In general, $R^2$ is the ratio between explained and total variance:\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\text{Explained variance in }Y}{\\text{Total variance in }Y}\n$$\n\nBased on this diagram, we can write this as:\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{C}{A + C}\n$$\n\nUsing actual numbers, we get\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{81.98}{317.87 + 81.98} = 0.205\n$$\n\nWe can do this more precisely with code:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npart_a <- ss_y - ss_both_y_x1\npart_c <- ss_both_y_x1\n\npart_c / (part_a + part_c)\n## [1] 0.205\n```\n:::\n\n\nAccording to this, `X1` explains 20.5% of the variation in `Y`. That's apparent visually—the overlapping space covers about 20% of the total `Y` circle.\n\nLet's run a regression model and check the $R^2$ value to see if it's the same:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(Y ~ X1, data = df) %>%\n  glance() %>%\n  pull(r.squared)\n## [1] 0.205\n```\n:::\n\n\nIncredible!! It's the same! That's so cool.\n\n\n### Relationship between three variables\n\nWhere this gets even more useful is when we look at the overlapping space between three different variables. It's also a little more complicated, since we need to calculate a bunch of different shared variances and do some set theory calculations to find the exact size of these different slivers of the diagram. Here's a general diagram of what we'll be calculating (this is unrelated to the data we've been working with and doesn't use any actual numbers—it's just a reference so we can find which shared variances we need to calculate):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(euler(c(\"Y\" = 4,\n             \"X1\" = 4,\n             \"X2\" = 4,\n             \"X1&Y\" = 2,\n             \"X2&Y\" = 2,\n             \"X1&X2\" = 2,\n             \"Y&X1&X2\" = 0.5)),\n     quantities = c(LETTERS[1:7]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-generic-3-rings-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis looks complicated, but the same principles apply. The entire circles for `Y`, `X1`, and `X2` represent each variable's total variance. Overlapping areas represent shared variance. For instance, the combination of D and G here (or $A \\cap B$) is the covariance that we calculated previously. The $R^2$ is still here too—the total explained variance in `Y` is the combination of D, E, and G, while A is the residual unexplained variance. That means we can calculate $R^2$ like this:\n\n$$\n\\frac{D + E + G}{A + D + E + G}\n$$\n\nThis visualization also helps with the intuition of $R^2$. Generally when you add additional variables to a regression model, the $R^2$ increases. That's because you're adding another circle to the diagram and absorbing more of the variation in the outcome. For instance, even though the numbers in this diagram aren't to scale at all, you can see that (D + G) (the $R^2$ that we calculated in the two-variable diagram) is smaller than (D + E + G). There's more explained variance here.\n\nTo calculate the actual values for each of these segments, we'll use `aov()` again to find the shared variance. This will involve a lot of different calculations and some algebra to isolate each segment. This table will help us keep everything straight:\n\n| Segment | Explanation | Code or algebra |\n| :------ | :---------- | :--- |\n| A + D + E + G | Total variation in `Y` | `ss(df$Y)` or `aov(Y ~ 1)` |\n| B + D + F + G | Total variation in `X1` | `ss(df$X1)` or `aov(X1 ~ 1)` |\n| C + E + F + G | Total variation in `X2` | `ss(df$X2)` or `aov(X2 ~ 1)` |\n| A       | Unexplained variation in `Y` after accounting for `X1` and `X2` | Residuals from `aov(Y ~ X2 + X1)` |\n| B       | Unexplained variation in `X1` after accounting for `Y` and `X2` | Residuals from `aov(X1 ~ Y + X2)` |\n| C       | Unexplained variation in `X2` after accounting for `Y` and `X1` | Residuals from `aov(X2 ~ Y + X1)` |\n| D + G   | Variance shared by `Y` and `X1` | `X1` in `aov(Y ~ X1)` |\n| E + G   | Variance shared by `Y` and `X2` | `X2` in `aov(Y ~ X2)` |\n| D + G   | Variance shared by `X1` and `X2` | `X2` in `aov(X1 ~ X2)` |\n| D       | Variance *only* between `Y` and `X1`, without influence from `X2` | (A + D + E + G) − A − (E + G) |\n| E       | Variance *only* between `Y` and `X2`, without influence from `X1` | (C + E + F + G) − C − (F + G) |\n| F       | Variance *only* between `X1` and `X2`, without influence from `Y` | (B + D + F + G) − B − (D + G) |\n| G       | Variance shared by `Y`, `X1`, and `X2` | (D + G) − D |\n\nPHEW. That's *a lot*. Here's all the code for it:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny_total <- ss(df$Y)    # A + D + E + G\nx1_total <- ss(df$X1)  # B + D + F + G\nx2_total <- ss(df$X2)  # C + E + F + G\n\n# A\ny_alone <- aov(Y ~ X2 + X1, data = df) %>%\n  tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == \"Residuals\") %>%\n  pull(sumsq)\n\n# B\nx1_alone <- aov(X1 ~ Y + X2, data = df) %>%\n  tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == \"Residuals\") %>%\n  pull(sumsq)\n\n# C\nx2_alone <- aov(X2 ~ Y + X1, data = df) %>%\n  tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == \"Residuals\") %>%\n  pull(sumsq)\n\n# D + G\ny_plus_x1 <- aov(Y ~ X1, data = df) %>%\n  tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == \"X1\") %>%\n  pull(sumsq)\n\n# E + G\ny_plus_x2 <- aov(Y ~ X2, data = df) %>%\n  tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == \"X2\") %>%\n  pull(sumsq)\n\n# F + G\nx1_plus_x2 <- aov(X1 ~ X2, data = df) %>%\n  tidy() %>%\n  filter(term == \"X2\") %>%\n  pull(sumsq)\n\n# D = (A + D + E + G) − A − (E + G)\ny_x1_alone <- y_total - y_alone - y_plus_x2\n\n# E = (A + D + E + G) − A − (D + G)\ny_x2_alone <- y_total - y_alone - y_plus_x1\n\n# G = (D + G) − D\ny_x1_x2_alone <- y_plus_x1 - y_x1_alone\n\n# F = (F + G) - G\nx1_x2_alone <- x1_plus_x2 - y_x1_x2_alone\n```\n:::\n\n\nAgain, that's super complex, but it's really just a ton of set theory algebra.\n\nNow that we have all these little pieces, let's plot them!\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall_pieces <- c(\"Y\" = y_alone,\n                \"X1\" = x1_alone,\n                \"X2\" = x2_alone,\n                \"X1&Y\" = y_x1_alone,\n                \"X2&Y\" = y_x2_alone,\n                \"X1&X2\" = x1_x2_alone,\n                \"Y&X1&X2\" = y_x1_x2_alone)\nall_pieces\n##       Y      X1      X2    X1&Y    X2&Y   X1&X2 Y&X1&X2 \n##   304.6   201.6   123.6    39.7    13.3    21.5    42.3\n\nplot(euler(all_pieces),\n     quantities = LETTERS[1:7])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-complex-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese circles are now all proportional to the actual values in the data. Both `X1` and `X2` explain some of the variation in `Y`, but not a ton (and `X1` explains more than `X2`). The explained variance is represented by the area D + E + G, which means we can now calculate the actual $R^2$:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{D + E + G}{A + D + E + G} = \\frac{39.69 + 13.27 + 42.29}{304.6 + 39.69 + 13.27 + 42.29} = 0.238\n$$\n\nOr with code:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(y_x1_alone + y_x2_alone + y_x1_x2_alone) /\n  (y_alone + y_x1_alone + y_x2_alone + y_x1_x2_alone)\n## [1] 0.238\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's confirm it with a regression model:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data = df) %>%\n  glance() %>%\n  pull(r.squared)\n## [1] 0.238\n```\n:::\n\n\nAMAZING. It's the same. It worked!\n\n### Nicer plot\n\nWith everything nice and proportional, let's make this plot a little fancier for teaching purposes. Since **eulerr** uses grid-based graphics, we can use it with [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) to add annotations (or combine it with other ggplot objects if we really wanted to):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(patchwork)  # For combining ggplot and grid elements\nlibrary(grid)       # For making custom grid grobs\nlibrary(latex2exp)  # For writing LaTeX-like text with grid plots\n\nnice_plot <- plot(euler(all_pieces),\n                  quantities = list(labels = LETTERS[1:7],\n                                    fontfamily = \"Roboto Condensed Light\",\n                                    fontsize = 16),\n                  fills = list(fill = c(\"#7FDBFF\", \"grey30\", \"grey80\",\n                                        \"#FF851B\", \"#FF851B\", \"grey50\", \"#FF851B\"),\n                               alpha = c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.35)),\n                  labels = list(fontfamily = \"Roboto Condensed\",\n                                fontface = \"bold\", fontsize = 20))\n\nmath_part <- textGrob(TeX(\"R^2 = \\\\frac{D + E + G}{A + D + E + G}\"),\n                      gp = gpar(fontfamily = \"Roboto Condensed\",\n                                col = \"grey50\", fontsize = 13))\n\n# Ordinarily patchwork works just fine with grid grob objects, like the results\n# from plot.euler(), but *not* when they're the first element in patchwork chain\n# of plots.

Multicollinearity leads to strange coefficient estimates and variance inflation because mathematically the regression model has no way of telling which of the highly correlated explanatory variables explain which parts of the outcome.\n\nIn the diagram, areas D and E are uniquely accounted for by `X1` and `X2` respectively, but G is is overlapped, making it impossible to know if `X1` or `X2` explains that portion of the variation in `Y`. Similarly, area F shows the variation shared by both `X1` and `X2`, and again it's impossible to know which parts are unique. As a result, the area (F + G) represents the total multicollinearity in the model:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(euler(all_pieces),\n     quantities = LETTERS[1:7],\n     fills = c(rep(\"white\", 5), rep(\"#FF4136\", 2)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-multicollinearity-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Why this matters\n\nOne really neat thing about thinking about $R^2$ this way is that it highlights a key difference in the purposes of regression: prediction and estimation.\n\nWith prediction, the goal of the regression model is to predict the outcome as accurately as possible. This is what Netflix does when guessing what show you might want to watch next, or what the [US Holocaust Museum does to predict genocide and human rights abuses](https://earlywarningproject.ushmm.org/). You throw in as many control variables as you can in order to create a model that explains variation in Y as accurately as possible. As a result, these kinds of models will typically have a high $R^2$.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(euler(c(\"Next show\\non Netflix\" = 1,\n             \"X1\" = 4,\n             \"X2\" = 6,\n             \"X3\" = 4,\n             \"X4\" = 6,\n             \"X5\" = 6,\n             \"X1&Next show\\non Netflix\" = 2,\n             \"X2&Next show\\non Netflix\" = 4,\n             \"X3&Next show\\non Netflix\" = 4,\n             \"X4&Next show\\non Netflix\" = 2,\n             \"X5&Next show\\non Netflix\" = 4,\n             \"X1&X2\" = 2,\n             \"Next show\\non Netflix&X1&X2\" = 0.5)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-diagram-prediction-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLook at that squishy little area of Y that's not explained by any of the other variables. Neato.\n\nIn the realm of causal inference in social science, or with estimation in general, the focus of the analysis is on *a single X variable* , like whether or not people in the sample participated in a social program. You might include a bunch of control variables if you identification strategy tells you do: an interaction term for time and group if you're using [difference-in-differences](https://evalf21.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/diff-in-diff/), an indicator showing if people are above/below a threshold if you're using [regression discontinuity](https://evalf21.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/rdd/), an instrument if you're using [instrumental variables](https://evalf21.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/iv/), confounding control variables if you're using [inverse probability weighting and a DAG](https://evalf21.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/matching-ipw/), or nothing(!) if you're using a [randomized controlled trial](https://evalf21.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/rcts/) (like you can really just run `lm(Y ~ treatment)`!). Each of these types of models will inevitably return an $R^2$ value, since that what regression does, but we care less about that when estimating causal effects. All we care about is the accuracy of one little sliver of the diagram—that single policy lever that we might have control over to influence the larger outcome.\n\nFor instance, let's say you're a new little nonprofit who created a cool new program to help reduce childhood poverty within your city. You want to know if that program does anything to poverty more generally. You have lots of donor money so you decide to run a carefully designed randomized trial. You run a regression model and get a tiny $R^2$ value, like 0.015. You panic because that means your experiment only explains 1.5% of the variation in poverty, and that seems really bad and low!\n\nBut that's actually totally fine. The goal with the experiment is *not* to explain all the factors that create poverty—there are far too many to include in a regression model. The goal here is to have an accurate estimate of how much your single program affects poverty. There's *no way* your little program is going to explain 80% of the variation in poverty. If you had a high $R^2$, I'd be incredibly worried! (Unless you really discovered a program that is a true silver bullet for poverty!)\n\nLooking at an Euler diagram demonstrates this more easily. All we care about in this experiment is that little sliver. Is it accurate? Does the treatment move the needle on poverty in any way? If so, great!\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(euler(c(\"Poverty\" = 100,\n             \"Program\" = 2,\n             \"Poverty&Program\" = 0.25)),\n     fills = c(\"white\", \"grey75\", \"#FF851B\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-diagram-estimation-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo don't dismiss models immediately just because of a low $R^2$! The purpose of the models matters!\n\n\n## Caveats\n\nThere are a few important caveats to keep in mind with these diagrams:\n\n**1: This is inefficient**\n\nCalculating each of these plot segments by hand is tedious and there will inevitably be typos and errors (there are probably errors in this very post!). Also, due to how ANOVA works, the order of the variables you specify matters *a lot*: `aov(Y ~ X1 + X2)` and `aov(Y ~ X2 + X1)` give completely different sum of squares for the joint variation of `Y`, `X1`, and `X2`. That in turn changes the sizes of the segments.\n\nWhen writing this, I spent way too much time playing with covariance matrices, partial correlation matrices, and variance-covariance matrices to see if I could calculate these areas more mathematically using the guts of regression and ANOVA, but it was too tricky. Smarter people than me will need to figure it out.\n\n**2: This doesn't work in all cases**\n\nIt's possible to have negative areas, depending on the data you have, and negative areas are unplottable (@Ip:2001 shows an example of this at the end of his article). In order to use this kind of diagram when teaching, you have to use carefully constructed data—you can't just throw any model into a chart like this. Also, when working with actual numbers, you're generally limited to just one or two explanatory variables. Any more and the math gets too complex.\n\n**3: This isn't 100% accurate**\n\nThe geometry behind creating these Euler diagrams is complex and doesn't always work perfectly. Let's plot the actual values of the sum of squares for each segment:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(euler(all_pieces),\n     quantities = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-complex-values-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat central piece where `Y`, `X1`, and `X2` is 42, but it's smaller any of the other intersections, which all have smaller sum-of-squares values. Yikes!\n\nThe **eulerr** package provides a way of diagnosing how bad things are by either inspecting the results of `euler()` directly, or looking at the residuals and errors with `error_plot()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neuler(all_pieces)\n##         original fitted residuals regionError\n## Y          304.6  303.9     0.742       0.001\n## X1         201.6  200.3     1.326       0.001\n## X2         123.6  121.3     2.319       0.002\n## Y&X1        39.7   47.6    -7.953       0.011\n## Y&X2        13.3   26.5   -13.236       0.018\n## X1&X2       21.5   33.0   -11.541       0.016\n## Y&X1&X2     42.3   10.7    31.558       0.042\n## \n## diagError: 0.042 \n## stress:    0.009\n\nerror_plot(euler(all_pieces),\n           quantities = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-errors-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat central piece is underrepresented, while the other intersections are overrepresented.
