How old is he really? \n\nIt turns out that Tolkien left us a clue in some of his unfinished writings about Númenor, and we can use that information to make some educated guesses about Aragon's actual human-scale age. In this post I'll (1) look at Tolkien's Númenórean years → human years conversion system and (2) extrapolate that system through two types of statistical simulation—(a) just drawing random numbers and (b) Bayesian modeling—to make some predictions about a range of possible ages.\n\nBut first, some context about why Aragon is so old!\n\n\n## Super quick crash course in the Ages of Arda + Númenor\n\n*The Lord of the Rings* occurs at the end of the Third Age of the world. In [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology_of_Tolkien%27s_legendarium#Arda) (the whole world Tolkien created) there are four recorded ages, plus some pre-game stuff:\n\n- **Creation**: The main god [Eru Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology_of_Tolkien%27s_legendarium#Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar) and a couple dozen sub-gods ([Ainur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainur_in_Middle-earth)) and bunch of angel-like-sub-sub-gods ([Maiar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiar_in_Middle-earth), including [Gandalf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf), [Saruman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saruman), and [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron)) created the world through music. This is all covered in the first part of [*The Silmarillion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion) in a sub-book called [*The Ainulindalë*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainulindal%C3%AB). \n\n- **The First Age**: After the creation, the Elves all lived in a place outside of the main world called [Valinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valinor) until the main bad guy, a fallen Ainu named [Morgoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgoth) (aka Melkor) destroyed key parts of it and divided the Elves so that a bunch fled to the far west of Middle-earth to a land called [Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beleriand). This starts the First Age, which is mostly about the Elves of Beleriand and their battles with Morgoth/Melkor. Sauron (the main bad guy of *The Lord of the Rings*) serves as Morgoth’s lieutenant and they destroy a ton of cities (with armies of balrogs and orcs) and kill a ton of elves. The elves eventually win, but all of Beleriand sinks into the ocean and the elves either go back to Valinor (technically just outside of Valinor, which serves as elvish heaven), or to eastern Middle-earth. This is all covered in the bulk of *The Silmarillion*.\n\n- **The Second Age**: While the First Age is mostly about elves, mortal men eventually show up in Beleriand and they play a key role in the battle against Morgoth. They also intermingle with the immortal elves, sometimes falling in love—including the famous [Lúthien and Beren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BAthien_and_Beren) (who are [stand-ins for Tolkien and his wife Edith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BAthien_and_Beren#The_Tolkien_grave)). Beren and Lúthien had kids, and their kids had kids, and so on until two half-elf brothers were born at the end of the First Age: [Elrond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elrond) (the same Elrond from *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Rings of Power*) and [Elros](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Elros). \n\n\tAs Beleriand sinks, Elrond and Elros escape to eastern Middle-earth and are then given a choice of how to proceed with their futures. Elrond decides to become immortal like an elf; Elros decides to become mortal like a man, eventually building [Rivendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivendell). The gods reward Elros and the men who helped the elves against Morgoth by creating a utopic island in the middle of the ocean between Valinor and Middle-earth named [Númenor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BAmenor). The gods also granted them super long life (400+ years, as we’ll explore below), but imposed a strict ban on them—the Númenóreans were forbidden from ever sailing west toward Valinor. Thus begins the two parallel stories of the Second Age—(1) Elrond and other refugees from Valinor doing stuff in Middle-earth, and (2) Elros and his descendants doing stuff on the island of Númenor. This is all covered in a final short part of *The Silmarillion* (the [*Akallabêth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion#Akallab%C3%AAth)), and in random appendices in *The Lord of the Rings*, and in the newer [*The Fall of Númenor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_N%C3%BAmenor), and in Amazon’s TV series [*The Rings of Power*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power).\n\n\tNúmenor and Middle-earth hum along happily for three thousand years until Sauron (who fled to Middle-earth after Morgoth was destroyed) shows up. He disguises himself as a super affable friendly dude who everyone loves and then sows chaos. He visits the elves and convinces them to make a bunch of rings, and then he heads to Númenor to convince them to violate the ban and sail to Valinor. The Númenóreans do, they get in trouble, the gods sink their island, and Númenórean refugees flee to Middle-earth, led by [Elendil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elendil) and his sons [Isildur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isildur) and [Anárion](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/An%C3%A1rion), who set up a Númenórean kingdom in [Gondor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondor). Sauron starts using his fancy new One Ring and tries to conquer Middle-earth; there’s a big war against him (see the first few minutes of *The Fellowship of the Ring*); Sauron kills Elendil; Isildur cuts off Sauron’s finger and makes him lose the ring, which destroys him; Isildur keeps the ring; he gets killed and the kingdom of Gondor falls, thus ending the Second Age.\n\n- **The Third Age**: The ring disappears for a few thousand years until Gollum picks it up, then Bilbo gets it in *The Hobbit*, and then Frodo gets it in *The Fellowship of the Ring* and destroys it in *The Return of the King*. \n\n\tMeanwhile, Gondor is ruled by a series of stewards who are supposed to take care of the kingdom until a Númenórean king returns to take his place. The magic long life of the Númenóreans starts declining, except for some special refugees from Gondor named the Dúnedain (singular Dúnadan), of which Aragorn is one. These Dúnedain maintain some of the magic Númenórean longevity—they don’t live 400+ years like their Númenórean ancestors, but they live well beyond 150. After the ring is destroyed, Aragorn is installed as king of Gondor, all the remaining elves go back to Valinor (except Arwen, Aragorn’s now-wife), and the Third Age ends.\n\n- **The Fourth Age**: Aragorn reigns until he’s 210, then he dies, someone else takes over, and Middle-earth lives happily ever after.\n\n## Packages\n\nBefore diving into the data and simulations, we need to load some R libraries and make some helper functions.

Tolkien writes:\n\n> (1) Deduct 20: Since at 20 years a Númenórean would be at about the same stage of development as an ordinary person.  \n> (2) Add to this 20 the remainder divided by 5. Thus a Númenórean man or woman of years [X] would be approximately of the \"age\" [Y] [@Tolkien:2022, \"The Life of the Númenóreans\", note 8, p. 262]\n\nAnd he provides this helpful table, which we'll stick in an R data frame so we can play with it:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nages <- tibble(\n  numenor_age = c(25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, \n                  250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425),\n  normal_human_age = c(21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56, 61, \n                       66, 71, 76, 81, 86, 91, 96, 101)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-ages-orig .cell .column-page-inset-right layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Tolkien\\'s original table for converting between Númenórean and human ages'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nages |> \n  rename(\"Númenórean age\" = numenor_age,\n         \"Normal human age\" = normal_human_age) |> \n  t() |> knitr::kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|                 |   |   |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\n|:----------------|--:|--:|--:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n|Númenórean age   | 25| 50| 75| 100| 125| 150| 175| 200| 225| 250| 275| 300| 325| 350| 375| 400| 425|\n|Normal human age | 21| 26| 31|  36|  41|  46|  51|  56|  61|  66|  71|  76|  81|  86|  91|  96| 101|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTolkien's logic is a little convoluted, but it works.

Denethor II—the [tomato-massacring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huvRffhxJXs) father of Boromir and Faramir—was the 26th steward and took the position 112 years after Belecthor II died. So it had been a long time since anyone had lived that long. With the exception of Aragorn and the other Dúnedan Rangers of the North, all the magic Númenórean power had waned. \n\nAfter the Ring was destroyed, something seems to have changed, though. Faramir—likely distantly related to the Dúnedain—[lived until 120](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Faramir), so *something* new was in the air at the beginning of the post-Sauron Fourth Age. Aragorn—an actual Dúnedan and descendant of Númenor—made it to 210, but he maybe had some special elf help from Arwen.\n\nSo given that some of the old Númenórean power seems to have returned (and given that Aragorn was unnaturally long-lived), we can try to figure out the Dúnedan → regular human age conversion three different ways.\n\n### Arbitrary maximum age\n\nSince the Númenórean → regular human age line is perfectly linear, we'll assume that the Dúnedan → regular human age line is also perfectly linear, just scaled down. We'll start the line at 16 again, but now we'll pretend that 210 years in Fourth Age Dúnedan years is 100 in human years (Aragorn lived a stunningly long time).\n\nTo figure out the equation for the new Dúnedan line, we need to figure out the slope. We have two points ($(0, 16)$ and $(210, 100)$) that we can use to calculate the slope:\n\nBy hand:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Slope} &= \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{100 - 16}{210 - 0} \\\\\n&= \\frac{84}{210} \\\\\n&= 0.4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOr with R:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nfind_slope <- function(point1, point2) {\n  (point2[2] - point1[2]) / (point2[1] - point1[1])\n}\n\nslope <- find_slope(c(0, 16), c(210, 100))\nslope\n## [1] 0.4\n```\n:::\n\n\nThat gives us this equation:\n\n$$\n\\text{Normal human years} = 16 + (0.4 \\times \\text{Dúnedan years})\n$$\n\n\nTo make it easier to plot things and plug numbers into the formula, we'll generate a dataset with a range of possible Dúnedan and regular human ages:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nages_dunedain <- tibble(dunedain_age = seq(20, 210, by = 1)) |>\n  mutate(normal_human_age = 16 + slope * dunedain_age)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing this equation, we can figure out Aragorn's normal human age during *The Lord of the Rings* and when he died:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nage_model_dunedain <- lm(normal_human_age ~ dunedain_age, data = ages_dunedain)\n\naugment(age_model_dunedain, newdata = tibble(dunedain_age = c(87, 210))) |>\n  rename(normal_human_age = .fitted)\n## # A tibble: 2 × 2\n##   dunedain_age normal_human_age\n##          <dbl>            <dbl>\n## 1           87             50.8\n## 2          210            100\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen Aragorn tells Eowyn that he's 87, that's actually the equivalent of 51ish.

As expected, most are around 0.4, resulting in a final age of 100, but some lines are steeper and some are shallower.
